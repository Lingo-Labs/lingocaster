# 🗣️ About
Lingocaster is a language learning game built on Farcaster. Learn a new language, earn rewards with streaks, & challenge friends in PYUSD! The game itself is built using Farcaster frames triggered by this [cast action](https://warpcast.com/~/add-cast-action?url=https://lingocaster.vercel.app/api/action). The AI translates a post and creates quiz questions for users, who can then play for daily points and compete on the leaderboard. With PYUSD, users can bet on their own streak, against a friend, or purchase in-game rewards.  

Some problems with current language learning apps that Lingocaster solves:

Using OpenAI, Lingocaster creates personalized learning that is integrated into real-world, crypto-native contexts. PYUSD lets us leverage PayPal’s large user base, so users can have a smoother + safer payments flow. By building on Farcaster, we create experiences that make language learning more social + cultural, which also helps get more users through viral loops.

## Betting
Users can either bet on their own streak and earn PYUSD from a weighted pool, or bet against a friend. When they bet a friend, a bot posts a challenge on their behalf - the bet will only go through if the challenged user accepts! Challenging a user is public, which introduces a viral loop + social element to the game to get more users.
